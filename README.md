# Python-LogIn-SignIn-Validator
This is a Python-based login and sign-in validator program. The program asks the user whether they want to sign in (register) or log in (authenticate). If the user chooses to sign in, their information is saved in a .txt file. When the user chooses to log in, the program verifies their login credentials against the stored data.
Additionally, a unique feature of this program is the automatic password generator, which generates a strong, secure password for the user during the sign-in process based on their input.
This project was developed as part of my End of First Semester Project.
# Features
- SignIn (Registration): Allows new users to register by providing a username and password. It also automatically generates a strong password based on user input.
- LogIn (Authentication): Allows users to authenticate by entering their username and password, which are verified against the saved data.
- Automatic Password Generator: During sign-up, the program generates a secure password based on user input, ensuring a strong password by default.
- Simple File-based Storage: User credentials are stored in a text file for simplicity.
